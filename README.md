# curveCreator

refactor of the original Curve tools
https://gumroad.com/l/WRtX

main goal of the tools is to make clean code that is ready for Python 3
maya code should be seperated in the Maya folder hopefully we can make some parts DCC agnostic to get the same or similar functionality in other dcc tools (future dev)
